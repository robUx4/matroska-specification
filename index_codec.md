This document intends to define this mapping for many commonly used codec in Matroska.

# Status of this document

This document is a work-in-progress specification defining the Matroska file format as part of the [IETF Cellar working group](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/cellar/charter/). It uses basic elements and concept already defined in the Matroska specifications defined by this workgroup.

# Security Considerations

Matroska Codecs inherits security considerations from EBML and Matroska.

# IANA Considerations

To be determined.
